# learn-html-css
This repository contains my practice code for the online course "Learn to Code HTML &amp; CSS" by Shay Howe.
http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/

This course is my second foray into the world of HTML and CSS. Originally, I tried to learn it with Free Code Camp, but their curriculum did not match my learning style. I have found that the clearer structure and more in-depth and thorough explanations procided by Shay Howe fit me much better.

This project was created by following along with the tutorial, and does not represent my own original work.
